# Health-Care-App-Design
Designed a UI prototype using proto.io for user to book appointment with doctor, bed in hospital & buy medicine on a single platform. Implemented AEIOU framework for systematic investigation and analysis of the domain. Created UML diagrams using Lucid chart to visualize the app's architecture, data flow, and interactions. Utilized Proto.io for developing interactive UI designs and prototypes.

# Problem Statement
In Covid19 scenario patients face challenges such as lack of access to medicine, difficulty in getting doctor appointments, and insufficient availability of beds in hospitals. To address these issues and promote social distancing, we aim to develop an app that provides online services for purchasing medicine, booking doctor appointments, and finding hospitals with bed availability.

# Project Objective
* Develop a single platform purchasing medicine, booking doctor appointments, and finding hospitals with bed availability.
* Ensure user-friendly and intuitive UI design in the app to enhance the overall user experience and facilitate easy navigation.
* Alleviate the challenges faced by these individuals and promote social distancing practices during times of healthcare resource constraints.
* Should provide real time information and should be secure
